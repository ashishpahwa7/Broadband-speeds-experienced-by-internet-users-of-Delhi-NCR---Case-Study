## Case Study: Broadband Speed experiences of Delhi-NCR's Internet Users
#### Background

India has over 1,98 crore fixed-line broadband subscribers, according to the latest data provided by the Indian Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI). Amid the surge in demand for the high-speed internet in wake of the shift to work from home due to the coronavirus outbreak, the government is considering a reduction in the license fee for fixed-line broadband services in the country.

As an individual, you must ensure that you have sufficient speed to not disrupt daily use, even when demand is at its highest. Some customers get lucky and have access to fiber connections of over 1000 Megabits (Mbps) per second while some rural businesses are stuck on 3 to 6Mbps DSL connections. With a growing number of ISPs offering “upto” 50mbps at affordable prices, how do you choose between them ? Just because the speed is advertised, doesn’t mean that’s the speed you’ll be receiving.
Data Source

Data for this study has been collected using internet speed test tools - speedtest.net, fast.com , M-Labs and cyberspeed. 122 responders were requested to register their measurement 2-3 times a day when they are closer to their wifi router. It was also ensured that no other devices were consuming a major portion of bandwidth when the measurement was taken.

## Data Preparation

The raw data was exported from MySQL database into a CSV file before loading into the R software. Since the dataset is not very large, it was convenient to identify NULL values using SQL and delete those rows there and then so it's readily available for statistical analysis.
